        Welcome! I am currently a 3rd year Ph.D. student in the 
        <a href="https://engineering.jhu.edu/chembe/" style="color: #0055ff">Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering</a>
        at the Johns Hopkins University. I work with 
        <a href="https://chemistry.jhu.edu/directory/rigoberto-hernandez/" style="color: #0055ff">Dr. Rigoberto Hernandez</a>
        to build data-driven models for material 
        property prediction across multiple length scales 
        and. These models are used in conjunction with 
        black box optimization algorithms to design 
        materials with bespoke properties.
        We are currently interested in building
        these models for Metal Halide Perovskite Solar Cells.

        Prior to joining in the Ph.D. program, I completed my 
        Masters in the same lab where I worked on developing 
        simulation tools to study the dynamics of unfolding
        of large proteins. My interest in studying biomolecules
        grew from undergraduate research where I worked on 
        building pseudo-kinetic models for Loop-Mediated
        Isothermal Amplication of DNA.

        My goal is to develop tools to aid scientists 
        in extracting insights from their data and 
        accelerate the discovery of new materials.
