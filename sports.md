<div style="text-align: justify;">
  I love biking and running. I started biking when I was in 
  college. My prelude to running began after I graduated from
  college in the Fall of 2019. What began as a competition 
  between a group of friends to see who could complete the
  most miles in a month, slowly turned into a passion
  for the sport and has stuck with me ever since.
  I am currently training for the Baltimore Marathon.
