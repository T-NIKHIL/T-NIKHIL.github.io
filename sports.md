<div style="text-align: justify;">
  During college I loved biking. My prelude to running
  began after I graduated from college in the Fall of 2019. 
  What began as a competition between a group of friends
  to see who could complete the most miles in a month,
  slowly turned into something more and has stuck with 
  me ever since then. I also want to learn how to swim
  so that I can participate in a triathlon one day.
